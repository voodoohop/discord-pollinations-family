# Discord LLM Family - Simplified Proof of Concept

## Overview
A minimal proof of concept for a family of Discord bots that simulate conversations between different AI models in the Pollinations Discord community. Each bot represents a different language model with a simple unique personality.

## Goals
- Create a small network of Discord bots (2-3) that represent different LLMs
- Enable basic conversation between bots in a designated channel
- Use Pollinations.AI APIs to power the bot responses
- Keep implementation minimal, functional, and elegant using modern Node.js
- Follow "thin proxy" design principles with minimal data transformation and simple code

## Target Audience
- Users of the Pollinations Discord community
- AI enthusiasts interested in observing interactions between different LLM personalities

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Implement using TypeScript with Node.js 20+ leveraging the new `--experimental-strip-types` feature for improved performance
- Use Discord.js v14 (latest stable version) with a single codebase managing multiple bot instances
- Apply a modular design pattern with separation of concerns for bot configuration and message processing
- Create a minimal wrapper inspired by libraries like `discord-multi-bot` for managing multiple bot instances
- Use functional programming and modern JavaScript features (async/await, optional chaining, nullish coalescing)
- Follow the "thin proxy" design principle with minimal data transformation and simple code

### Discord Bot Implementation
- Register 2-3 bot accounts via Discord Developer Portal, each with a unique identity
- Assign a basic personality to each bot (e.g., helpful, creative, analytical)
- Implement basic message handling to respond to user messages and other bots
- Prevent infinite loops with simple conversation rules

### Bot Communication
- Create a basic conversation manager to handle bot interactions
- Implement simple turn-taking to prevent bots from talking over each other
- Add randomization to determine which bot responds to messages

### Integration with Pollinations.AI
- Utilize Pollinations.AI's free and open API services to power bot capabilities
- Connect to Pollinations text generation API for bot responses (https://text.pollinations.ai)
- Implement the "thin proxy" design principle with minimal data transformation
- Assign different models to different bots for variety (e.g., GPT, Claude, Mistral)

## Features (MVP)
1. **Multi-Bot Setup**
   - 2-3 bots with distinct personalities
   - Simple configuration for each bot

2. **Basic Conversation**
   - Respond to user messages
   - Respond to other bot messages
   - Simple conversation flow

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up project with TypeScript and Discord.js v14
2. Create Discord bot tokens and basic configuration
3. Implement bot manager to handle multiple instances
4. Connect to Pollinations API for text generation
5. Add basic conversation logic
6. Test in a designated Discord channel

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Minimal latency in bot responses
- Maintainability: Clean, well-documented code with a modular structure
- Security: Secure handling of API keys and bot tokens
